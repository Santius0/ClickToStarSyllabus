What are Meta Tags?

Meta tags, <meta>, provides metadata about the HTML document. 
Metadata is a set of data that describes and gives information about other data
Example: 
Info on student named John:
Age - 15
Sex - male
Form - form 4
Grade average - 70%
The Metadata could describe this student for other purposes, such as looks
Height - 164cm
Eye colour - brown
body size - medium

In HTML, meta elements are typically used to specify page description, keywords
,author of the document, last modified, and other metadata

Meta tags always go inside the <header> elements and is always passed as mane value pairs
Example:
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
  <meta name="keywords" content="HTML,CSS,XML,JavaScript">
  <meta name="author" content="John Doe">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</head>

The <meta> viewport element should be included in all web pages.
This gives the browser instructions on how how to control the page's dimensions and scaling
The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device 
(which will vary depending on the device).
The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

Property Meta Tags

When sharing a website on social media, it's desplayed as a name, picture and website in one block.
Example, when sharing a YouTube link on WhatsApp, it appears as a picture and description below as one group.
Meta tags allow for this to be possible.

Using Facebook as the primary example, when a link is shared, it takes the associated webpage and reads
its <meta> tags to display the appropriate information.
Facebook does this by using the Open Graph Meta-Tag
The 4 required tags to make this possible on Facebook are: Title, Description, Image and URL

<meta property="og:title" content="European Travel Destinations">
<meta property="og:description" content="Offering tour packages for individuals or groups.">
<meta property="og:image" content="http://euro-travel-example.com/thumbnail.jpg">
<meta property="og:url" content="http://euro-travel-example.com/index.htm">

The minimum size of the picture should be  200 x 200 pixels, and the size must not exceed 8MB.
For the best display, use images that are at least 1200 x 630 pixels. Try to keep images as close to 1.91:1 aspect ratio as possible
to display the full image in News feed without cropping.

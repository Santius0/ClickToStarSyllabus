What are Meta Tags?

Meta tags, <meta>, provides metadata about the HTML document. 
Metadata is a set of data that describes and gives information about other data

The Metadata could describe this student for other purposes, such as looks

In HTML, meta elements are typically used to specify page description, keywords
,author of the document, last modified, and other metadata

Meta tags always go inside the <header> elements and is always passed as mane value pairs
Example:
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
  <meta name="keywords" content="HTML,CSS,XML,JavaScript">
  <meta name="author" content="John Doe">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</head>

The <meta> viewport element should be included in all web pages.
This gives the browser instructions on how how to control the page's dimensions and scaling
The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device 
(which will vary depending on the device).
The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

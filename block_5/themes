Websites for Mobile and Desktops

Websites can be made specifically for mobile devices. These websites usually start with m. Example, m.facebook.com.
Creating websites specifically for mobile devices usually means that you now have 2 websites to maintain and update rather than 1.

If you want a website that could work both on desktops and mobile devices, in the css section, the page size is set dynamically.
It's usually set with minimum values and can be increase according to the size of the device using viewport.
These are called dynamic websites.

JavaScript

JavaScript is one of the 3 core languages of websites.
HTML - controls the structure of your webpage
CSS - controls the presentation/design
JavaScript - adds behaviour and interactivity

If in the website you have a gallery and you want users to be able to zoom in and out of your images, JavaScript would be best to use
to get that function.

JavaScript is a scripting language. It is intentionally limited, doesn't have the same features as other programming languages, cannot communicate
directly with a database or file system on a computer, but it is great at manipulating web pages.

JavaScript is a client side language, meaning that it runs on your browser.
Note:
JavaScript is not and has nothing to do with Java. The official name for JavaScript is ECMAScript

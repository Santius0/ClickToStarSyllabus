# Setup

What we're building?

![Screenshot of completed step](screenshot02.png)

Let's begin by creating the HTML markup for our main page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title>Marcus Sanatan</title>
</head>

<body>
    <img src="images/marcus.jpg" alt="Picture of Marcus Sanatan, website owner" width="300px">
    <h1>Marcus Sanatan</h1>
    <p>Musings of a little coder in the Caribbean</p>
</body>

</html>
```

This landing page contains a few things:

* Title of the web page, which should be your name
* An image of yourself (ideal dimensions are 650x650). Don't forget to write a nice description of the image in the `alt` attribute so those with screen readers will know what's on the webpage.
* Your name in the `h1` tag
* A nice summary of what this site is about in the `p` tag

## Make It Your Own

This is **your** website, make sure you put the content that refelcts who **you** are.
